description: login vs log in...

There is something that can be a little confusing from a user experience perspective and that's the words used to describe some authentication actions. 

* login vs log in, 
* logout vs log out, 
* signin vs sign in 
* signup vs sign up. 



I sometimes see this question pop up once in a while.

> When we have a button on a website for creating an account, should it say "sign up" or "signup"?



What we have to identity and remember is which one is a verb and which one is used as a noun.

Wikipedia says:

> The verbs are two words: log in and log out, whereas the nouns are login and logout (often used like adjectives in compound nouns).



So the Login Form is the name of a form but the action to instruct the user is **Log in** often used in the title of the form. 

My confusion sometimes is when to use the sign in vs sign up, although I know which one is which, because they are so similar they can be confusing for the user. 

At the end I opt to use Sign up for a user to register and Log in for the user to authenticate itself. 

By the way autocorrect is screaming at me that "signin" is not a word.  ðŸ˜…
