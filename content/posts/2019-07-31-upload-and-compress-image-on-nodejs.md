Hi.

So here's my current problem.

I want my web app to use images uploaded from users and with the crazy resolutions from phones nowadays we can get an idea of how bad it can get. ðŸ˜…

So my plan is this:

* Multer to handle the upload.
* Tinypng to compress the images
* Cloudinary to serve and store the compressed images

All of this will be tied on a Mongo, Express and Node package.

Wish me luck!
